## Very Short Bio

I am a ~~PhD student~~ (graduated May 7) @INRIA Grenoble-Alpes in the STATIFY team. Prior to that, I studied Maths & Computer Science at Grenoble INP - Ensimag and Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London.
Living in Grenoble, France, I can be found skiing during winter and cycling during summer.

## Research Interests

My research revolves around computational methods for Bayesian inference. In particular, my PhD topic focuses on Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design, which involves designing the most efficient experiments or measurements to maximize the information gained from limited data. As this is a nested sampling and optimization problem, I have become quite interested in sampling and optimization problems and the equivalence between the two.
