## Very Short Bio

I am a Phd student @INRIA Grenoble-Alpes in the amazing STATIFY team. Prior to that, I studied Maths & Computer Science at Grenoble INP - Ensimag and Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London.
I am Italian, but have been living in France since the age of 7.
Now living in Grenoble, France, I can be found skiing during winter and cycling during summer.

## Research Interests

My research evolves around computational methods for Bayesian Inference. In particular, my Phd topic is centered around Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design that is the problem of designing most efficient experiments or measurements to perform in order to maximize the information gained from limited data.
As this is a nested sampling/optimisation problem, I became quite interested in sampling and optimisation problems and the equivalence between the two.
