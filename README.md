## Very Short Bio

I am a ~~PhD student~~ (graduated in May) @INRIA Grenoble-Alpes in the STATIFY team. Prior to that, I studied Maths & Computer Science at Grenoble INP - Ensimag and Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London.
Living in Grenoble, France, I can be found skiing during winter and cycling during summer.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on computational methods for Bayesian inference, with a particular emphasis on Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). I am interested in how to design efficient experiments or measurements to maximize information gain under limited data and computational budgets.

This naturally leads me to questions at the interface of:

- Sampling and optimization methods and their connections
- Diffusion model sampling for inverse problems and scientific imaging  
- Efficient diffusion architectures and training strategies, especially under conditioning or structured constraints
- Generative modeling approaches for scientific computation and uncertainty quantification

I am also interested in the practical deployment of BED and diffusion-based methods in real experimental systems, particularly in imaging and engineering applications.
